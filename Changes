 [ Packaging ]
 - Fix copyright coverage to include current year.
 - Fix require MooX::Log::Any.
 - Require IPC::System::Simple.
 - Tighten Moo requirement to at least 1.001000 (older are untested with
   Type::Tiny).

 [ Other ]
 - Add --suite option (and drop it as 2nd argument) in compose command,
   allowing multiple nodes instead.
 - Added: Handle nodes, classes and skeleton files with separate options in
   compose command.
 - Added: Include builting skeleton files, and ship with example classes
   and nodes.
 - Explicitly use IPC::System::Simple (already implicitly used via autodie
   + system() call).
 - Refactor to strip undefined args handed over internally - a.k.a. coerce
   Undef to default, to permit callers to sloppily pass App::Cmd options
   as-is.
