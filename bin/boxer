=head1 DESCRIPTION

boxer is a single front-end to various "boxing" tasks - i.e. structured
system-wide tasks commonly applied in batch to larger deployments.

Unlike tools like Puppet, CFEngine and Chef which operates on top of an
installed system, boxer preferrably interacts with the packaging system
of the system.  Boxer is inspired by Fully Automated Installer (FAI) and
the classes are modelled after that tool, but goal of boxer is to become
obsolete: boxer can include custom tweaks but encourages avoiding them
and instead pass upstream to distro designers the needed customizations.

The core distribution includes commands to analyze, initialize and
refresh a Debian(-based) operating system.

However, boxer is pluggable and it is anticipated that plugins on CPAN
will cover other related tasks.
